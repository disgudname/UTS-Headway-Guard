# UTS Headway Guard

UTS Headway Guard is a proof-of-concept service and lightweight web UI for reducing bus bunching on transit routes.
It gathers live data from TransLoc and the OpenStreetMap Overpass API, computes target headways, and exposes the results through FastAPI for drivers and dispatchers.

## Features
- Polls TransLoc for route geometry and live vehicle positions.
- Fetches and caches OSM speed limits and low-clearance data via Overpass.
- Computes arc-based headways and recommended actions (OK/Ease off/HOLD).
- Exposes REST endpoints for health, routes, vehicles, per-vehicle instructions, and low-clearance warnings.
- Streams per-route status via Server-Sent Events for live updates.
- Serves minimal dispatcher and driver web clients with overheight alerts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
Start the development server with:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8080
```

Open the [driver](http://localhost:8080/driver) and [dispatcher](http://localhost:8080/dispatcher) pages in a browser.

## API

Key endpoints exposed by the service:
- `/v1/health` – service health and last error.
- `/v1/routes` – active routes with current status.
- `/v1/routes_all` – all known routes with active flags.
- `/v1/roster/vehicles` – roster of vehicle names.
- `/v1/vehicles` – live vehicle positions.
- `/v1/low_clearances` – low-clearance locations near the bridge.
- `/v1/routes/{route_id}/status` – headway status for a route.
- `/v1/routes/{route_id}/vehicles/{vehicle_name}/instruction` – driver instruction for a vehicle.
- `/v1/stream/routes/{route_id}` – Server-Sent Events stream.
- `/v1/leader_events` – recent leader-loss events for debugging.

## Configuration
Runtime settings can be tuned with environment variables such as `TRANSLOC_BASE`, `TRANSLOC_KEY` and `OVERPASS_EP`.
See `app.py` for the full list and default values.

## Docker
Build and run a containerised instance:
```bash
docker build -t uts-headway-guard .
docker run -p 8080:8080 uts-headway-guard
```
